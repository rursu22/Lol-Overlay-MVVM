## Architecture

- **MVVM pattern**  
  - **Models** handle data and services (encryption, file I/O, computer vision)  
  - **ViewModels** expose `ICommands` & bindable properties  
  - **Views** (XAML + code-behind) purely for UI

## Security & Privacy

- **All data is stored locally**, encrypted with AES  
- **No external servers**‚Äîthe overlay never sends your credentials over the network  
- **Open-source**: inspect or modify as you wish
